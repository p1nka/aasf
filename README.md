### The Automated Agent Scaffolding Framework

The goal of this framework is to take a document (like the PDF you provided) as input and produce structured, machine-readable definitions and even boilerplate code for the agents described within it.

Here is the design, broken down by the agents that would power this framework:

---

#### **Agent 1: Document Ingestion & Parsing Agent**

This is the entry point. It's responsible for making the document readable for the other agents.

*   **Primary Function:** To accept various document formats, perform Optical Character Recognition (OCR) if necessary, and parse the document into a structured text format with metadata.
*   **Key Capabilities:**
    *   **File Handling:** Accepts PDF, DOCX, Markdown, and other formats.
    *   **OCR Engine:** Uses libraries like Tesseract or cloud services (Google Vision AI) to convert scanned images within a PDF into text.
    *   **Layout Analysis:** Identifies structural elements like headers, paragraphs, lists, tables, and code blocks. This is crucial for understanding context.
    *   **Output:** Produces a structured representation of the document (e.g., a JSON object with a list of pages, sections, and their content).

#### **Agent 2: Agent Definition Discovery Agent**

This agent acts like a scout, finding the relevant sections that describe the agents to be created.

*   **Primary Function:** To scan the parsed document and identify all sections that contain definitions of individual agents.
*   **Key Capabilities:**
    *   **Pattern Recognition:** Looks for recurring header patterns like `"X.Y Agent Name (AGENT-ID)"` or sections titled `"Agent Specifications"`.
    *   **Keyword Triggering:** Uses a dictionary of keywords (`"Agent ID"`, `"Primary Function"`, `"Type"`, `"Priority"`) to flag potential agent definition blocks.
    *   **Semantic Search:** Employs a language model to understand sentences that describe an agent's purpose, even if they don't follow a strict format.
    *   **Output:** A list of "candidate sections" from the document that are highly likely to contain agent definitions.

#### **Agent 3: Structured Data Extraction Agent**

This is the core intelligence of the framework. It reads the candidate sections and pulls out the specific details for each agent.

*   **Primary Function:** To perform fine-grained information extraction on the identified sections to populate a structured schema.
*   **Key Capabilities:**
    *   **Named Entity Recognition (NER):** Trained to identify specific entities like `Agent ID`, `Type`, `Priority`, `Resource Requirements`, and `Capabilities`.
    *   **Table Parsing:** Can specifically target and extract data from structured formats like the "Capabilities Matrix" or "Error Handling" tables.
    *   **Code Block Extraction:** Identifies and isolates code snippets (Python, YAML) associated with an agent.
    *   **Schema Mapping:** Fills a predefined JSON schema with the extracted information.
*   **Output:** A structured JSON object for each discovered agent. For example, for the `DOC-ANALYZER-001` agent, it would produce:
    ```json
    {
      "agent_id": "DOC-ANALYZER-001",
      "agent_name": "Document Analysis Agent",
      "primary_function": "Automated document processing and compliance verification",
      "type": "Core Processing Agent",
      "priority": "High",
      "resource_requirements": {
        "cpu": "2 cores",
        "ram": "4GB RAM"
      },
      "capabilities": [
        {"capability": "OCR Processing", "accuracy_rate": "98.5%", "processing_time": "30 seconds"},
        {"capability": "Document Classification", "accuracy_rate": "99.1%", "processing_time": "5 seconds"}
      ],
      "source_document_section": "3.1"
    }
    ```

#### **Agent 4: Agent Registry & Scaffolding Agent**

This is the final "builder" agent. It takes the structured JSON and creates tangible assets.

*   **Primary Function:** To populate a central agent registry and automatically generate starter files (code, configuration) based on the extracted data.
*   **Key Capabilities:**
    *   **Database Population:** Connects to a database (like the one we designed earlier) and populates the `Agents` table with the new definitions.
    *   **Code Generation:** Uses templates (e.g., Jinja templates) to generate boilerplate Python class files. For `DOC-ANALYZER-001`, it might create a file `doc_analyzer_001.py` with a structure like:
        ```python
        # Agent: DOC-ANALYZER-001
        # Type: Core Processing Agent
        # Priority: High
        class DocumentAnalysisAgent:
            def __init__(self):
                # TODO: Initialize resources (2 CPU cores, 4GB RAM)
                pass

            def process_document(self, input_data):
                # TODO: Implement OCR, Classification, and Compliance Checking logic
                pass
        ```
    *   **Configuration Generation:** Creates initial configuration files, such as a Kubernetes deployment YAML, pre-filled with the agent's name and resource requirements.

### **Workflow of the Framework**

The process would be fully automated:

1.  **Input:** An administrator uploads the `RERA_AUDIT_AGENTS_DOCUMENTATION_v1.0.pdf`.
2.  **Ingestion:** The **Ingestion Agent** parses the PDF into structured text.
3.  **Discovery:** The **Discovery Agent** scans the text and identifies the 18 agent definition sections.
4.  **Extraction:** The **Extraction Agent** processes each of the 18 sections, generating 18 detailed JSON objects.
5.  **Scaffolding:** The **Scaffolding Agent** takes the 18 JSON objects and:
    *   Adds 18 new rows to the `Agents` database table.
    *   Creates 18 corresponding `agent_name.py` starter files in the codebase.
    *   Generates 18 initial `agent_name.yaml` configuration files.
6.  **Human Review:** The system flags the newly scaffolded agents for a developer or system architect to review, approve, and then implement the specific business logic (`# TODO` sections).

This framework creates a powerful, specification-driven development loop where updating the central documentation can automatically trigger the creation or updating of agent skeletons in your system, ensuring consistency and dramatically speeding up development.
